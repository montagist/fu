# Fu
Companion tool to [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck). Based on heuristics instead of specific rules

Fu could stand for a lot of things.

Could be about the [kung fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_fu_(term)) - "a Chinese term referring to any study, learning, or practice that requires patience, energy, and time to complete" - of the command line.

Perhaps short for "fudged", as in "I just fudged that command!".

Or maybe just fu as in "Eff You!", said in exclamation towards your terminal
